# Deep-Learning-Project---KC-House-Sales
A start to finish project where I build a deep learning model to predict house prices using kaggles KC house sales dataset.

## EDA 
- Visualise key features using seaborn and locate noteworthy trends
- Created a map of properties to show geographical price differences

## Preprocessing 
- Dropped unimportant features
- Created Year and Month feature from Date column
- Used zipcode feature to seperate properties into 3 geographical groups

## Deep learning model
- Performed a train-test split and scaled the data
- Built, fitted and evaluated a baseline model
- Created and evaluated an improved model by empirical testing
